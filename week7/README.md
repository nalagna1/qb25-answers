Exercise 1.3

One of each of the replicates for the fe and LFC.fe appear to be in the wrong
clusters.
It appears as though the first principle component is posterior vs. anterior.
All of the clusters to the left relative to the PC1 axis are anterior tissues, while
all of the clusters to the right relative to the PC1 axis are posterior tissues.

Exercise 3

Gene cluster 3 makes sense because all of the enriched genes appear to have something
to do with metabolism or enzymatic processes in general (e.g., amylase, lipase,
metalloprotease).

Gene cluster 7 also makes sense because the enrichments appear to for mitochondrial
proteins (e.g., oxidoreductase).
